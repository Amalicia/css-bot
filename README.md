-----To Do-----
!poll option1 option2... - Send a message afterwards with the current scores ranked in order of votes. Get votes by reactions

!timer [end time] [reminder interval] - Pings a reminder with time left every [reminder interval] until [end time]. [end time] could be many formats (dd/mm/yy or hours:minutes etc.) so need to overload !timer function (limit to css-comittee role)

!remind - ping users that react with certain emoji in DM to remind of an event (css-comittee role can remind everyone that reacted but non css-comittee can only remind themselves)

~!StudentFinance - print the date of the next student finance payment and the time left from https://studentfinancecountdown.com~
